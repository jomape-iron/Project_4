# Employee Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze employee data by performing data cleaning and visualization using Python and Tableau. The project utilizes two CSV files: one containing personal information of employees and another with the employment history.

# Overview

The Employee Data Analysis project focuses on extracting insights from employee data to facilitate decision-making processes. By performing data cleaning and visualization, the project aims to identify hiring trends, analyze medical leaves, and forecast employee exits.

# Data Sources

The project utilizes two main data sources:

- Personal Information CSV: Contains personal details of the employees, such as names, addresses, and contact information.
- Employment History CSV: Includes information related to employee records, such as employment start and end dates, or medical leave records.

# ETL Process

The data cleaning and transformation process was conducted using Python. The steps involved in the ETL process were as follows:

    Data extraction: The project imported the employee data from the CSV files into Python using appropriate libraries.

    Data cleaning: The data was cleaned to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency.

    Data transformation: Necessary transformations were applied to the data to enable meaningful analysis and visualization.

    Data loading: The cleaned and transformed data was loaded into Tableau for further analysis and visualization.

# Visualizations

The project utilizes Tableau to create the following visualizations:

## Map of Barcelona

This visualization presents a map of Barcelona, highlighting the concentration of employees based on postal codes. It provides insights into the geographical distribution of the workforce.

## Line Graph - Hiring Trends

This line graph illustrates the hiring trends from 2015 to 2022, divided into quarterly intervals. It helps in identifying periods with higher hiring rates, allowing for better workload distribution among the recruitment team.

## Line Graph - Medical Leaves

This line graph showcases the occurrence of medical leaves during the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, categorized by quarters. It aids in identifying periods with higher medical leave rates, enabling effective planning for additional hiring to cover the medical leaves.

## Line Graph - Employee Exits

This line graph displays the employee exit trends during the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, segmented by quarters. It assists in predicting workload in the human resources department and planning for potential replacements.
